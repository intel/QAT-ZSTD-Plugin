 *
 * @param sequenceProducerState  A pointer to a user-managed state for QAT sequence producer,
 *                               users need to call QZSTD_createSeqProdState to create it, and
 *                               call QZSTD_freeSeqProdState to free it.
 * @param outSeqs                The output buffer for QAT sequence producer. The memory backing
 *                               outSeqs is managed by the CCtx.
 * @param outSeqsCapacity        outSeqsCapacity is guaranteed >= ZSTD_sequenceBound(srcSize).
 * @param src                    An input buffer for the sequence producer to parse.
 * @param srcSize                The size of input buffer which is guaranteed to be <= ZSTD_BLOCKSIZE_MAX.
 * @param dict                   Dict buffer for sequence producer to reference. Currently, it's a NULL pointer,
 *                               and will be supported in the future.
 * @param dictSize               The size of dict. Currently, zstd will always pass zero into sequence producer.
 * @param compressionLevel       Zstd compression level, only support L1-L12.
 * @param windowSize             Representing the maximum allowed offset for sequences
 *
 * @retval size_t                Return number of sequences QAT sequence producer produced
 *                               or error code: ZSTD_SEQUENCE_PRODUCER_ERROR.
 * *** LIMITATIONS ***
 *  - Only support compression level from L1 to L12.
 *  - ZSTD sequence producer only support zstd compression API which respect advanced parameters.
 *  - The ZSTD_c_enableLongDistanceMatching cParam is not currently supported. Compression will fail
 *    if it is enabled and tries to compress with qatsequenceproducer.
 *  - Dictionaries are not currently supported. Compression will not fail if the user references
 *    a dictionary, but the dictionary won't have any effect.
 *  - Stream history is not currently supported. All advanced ZSTD compression APIs, including
 *    streaming APIs, work with qatsequenceproducer, but each block is treated as an independent
 *    chunk without history from previous blocks.
 *  - Multi-threading within a single compression is not currently supported. In other words,
 *    compression will fail if ZSTD_c_nbWorkers > 0 and an external sequence producer is registered.
 *    Multi-threading across compressions is fine: simply create one CCtx per thread.
